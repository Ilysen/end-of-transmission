It's an IPS-N model, constructed to extract, refine, store, and transport liquid fuel across the vastness of Diasporan space. As far as construction goes, the Cetacean is an older ship, built in 4912u; not so old to be considered antiquated, but old enough that its model is no longer in active production, and instead remains on long-term support. After its decommissioning by IPS-N in 4967u following half a century of service, Access Corridor bought the ship, retrofitted it, and integrated into their burgeoning fleet as their new flagship. Now that Access Corridor has been acquired by IPS-N directly and the corpro's new star player (the Empyrean ) is four times as large, the Cetacean has returned to its roots: performing slow, ponderous routes on the edge of inhabited space, like it did in its childhood years. So it goes. The Cetacean is old, but rugged. Although its core infrastructure has aged substantially and runs inefficiently, it has been kept in serviceable condition across its lifetime and shows no signs of stopping anytime soon. Malfunctions, mechanical quirks, and unexplainable fluctuations in system efficiency are commonplace; but as its two past captains each attest, if you can adjust to the many problems it has, you'd be hard-pressed to find a ship that's more reliable and less unpredictable than the Cetacean. Come rain or shine, it'll get where it needs to go, no questions asked -- as long as you're patient with it. Crew The Cetacean is built to comfortably house just over a hundred full-time staff, and features barracks-style bunks for temporary contractors as well as eight dozen tightly-packed personal rooms for extended or permanent assignments. Its stasis chambers contain enough sarcophagi to accommodate the entire crew in rotation, plus some extra just in case. It's currently running at full capacity, with an even one hundred personnel across its roster. Specifications As a fuel freighter, the Cetacean's dedicated role is acquiring, refining, storing, and transporting industrial amounts of fusion fuel. The ship is fully equipped to smoothly facilitate every part of this process, and features fuel scoops for mining gaseous hydrogen from gas giants, an expansive refinery and compressor, and several thousand cubic meters of storage space. The industrial sections and hangar deck of the ship connect to a dedicated print shop, inside of which lies a Schedule 2 printer and a series of mulchers used for turning rock, unrefined ore, and raw material into feedstock. For smaller projects or personal use, portable printers can be found in designated stations scattered throughout the Cetacean and accessed freely by any members of the crew. Owing to Access Corridor's focus on moving people as much as they move hardware, the Cetacean is equipped with a row of two dozen extended-stay passenger cabins along the starboard edge of the ship, each the size of a small hotel room. A short walk connects the cabins to the main amenities, which are also shared by the crew: a small gym, a feature-complete canteen and rec room, observation blisters at the fore and aft ends of the ship, a computer lab, and so on. Passengers are issued personal keycards for their stay, each of which grants full access to designated public areas of the ship; their movement into work areas, however, is forbidden without first receiving temporary access from a crew member. The Ceteacean draws its power from a military-grade fusion reactor. It's enough to cover daily draw even while running at low speed, and its moment-to-moment production can be easily scaled up as needed to provide a hefty excess for short-term emergency hookups or periods of increased power draw. Portable generators are kept in reserve in case of an outage or malfunction, whereupon they can be wheeled out and fed from the plentiful fuel reserves that the ship carries. Because the Cetacean is a long-haul freighter -- one that can spend months or years in realtime without returning to port -- the ship is designed to be as self-sufficient as possible. The ship houses a modest hydroponics farm as well as fully-stocked urgent care and medical treatment facilities, including surgical theatres and genemod kiosks. Two smaller vessels are present in the Cetacean's hangar, used as away craft: the first is a nippy shuttle called the Dolphin, which is capable of atmospheric entry and carries up to a dozen human-sized passengers and two tons of cargo. The second, a ponderous transport ship called the Walrus, is intended for zero-g use only and can carry nearly two hundred tons of supplies or up to four industrial mechs for transport or mining purposes. Last but not least, the Cetacean's systems contain full infrastructure for use by an administrative NHP, although at present the casket chamber is unoccupied and has instead been repurposed as storage. Defenses The Cetacean isn't equipped for combat, and ideally wants to avoid it whenever possible. Owing to its size and the fact that it typically travels at nearlight, interdiction by pirates is typically a low risk, and this tactic of dissuasion is the Cetacean's main defense; in the event of an engagement, its first priority would be to flee. Failing that, bargaining or submitting to reasonable demands (such as partial forfeiture of cargo) would be vastly preferable to fighting. If worst comes to worst, however, the Cetacean does remain an industrial ship; its hull is sloped and reinforced to deflect micrometeorites traveling at nearlight speeds can effortlessly soak up minor impacts and small weapons fire and is difficult to penetrate even with purpose-built hull busters. In a worst-case scenario, it can serve to absorb incoming shots aimed for critical parts of the ship long enough to evacuate them. For offensive capabilities, the Cetecean has only a single option: multipurpose point-defense lasers mounted on gimbals across the hull. Under normal circumstances, these lasers run on an extra-low power setting, and automatically target oncoming asteroids to neutralize them before they strike the hull. They can safely be configured for sustained high power operation (for slicing apart rocks and debris), and could also theoretically be overclocked to fire in ultra-high power bursts for offensive use -- although doing so would place a great deal of strain on the reactor. If all else fails, the Cetacean's main drive can theoretically be forced into a nearlight bolt. Although the ship is technically built to withstand the maneuver, the drive core is usually a long-spool piece of hardware that accelerates very slowly. Pushing it so hard would undoubtedly cause potentially catastrophic damage to its systems and render it unable to function normally without days of repairs; as such, the maneuver remains an absolute last resort. Hierarchy Chain of command aboard the Cetacean is oligarchic, with authority based on a priority system ranging from low numbers (more authority) to high numbers (less authority). This doesn't extend across ships; the captain of the Cetacean doesn't have any inherent authority over the crew of another ACO-affiliated ship, and vice versa. Access Corridor employs the ship's executive track directly, and perhaps more importantly owns the ship itself as well as any resources, current and future, used to keep it operational. Although they're generally hands-off and content to let the ship run itself as long as it makes a profit, they and their representatives have full authority and jurisdiction over the ship. As the Cetacean is one of Access Corridor's largest and most expensive assets, they have a strong interest in keeping it under their control. From deciding its day-to-day operations and serving as the final arbiter for disagreements or requests for advice, the corpro itself is top dog. The crew is divided into \"tracks\" -- Access Corridor's way of referring to the divisions within the ship's hierarchy. These include: The executive track, responsible for greasing the bureaucratic gears of the ship and ensuring that the crew has the resources they need to do their jobs. Composed of managers, accountants, and aides, they coordinate the other tracks as well as serving as the ship's liaisons with outsiders and the company itself; The maintenance track keeps the ship in working order by working on its superstructure, securing transport and cargo, managing the reactor and engines, and configuring the point-defense lasers. They're also responsible for appropriating and processing resources as needed -- most notably operating the scooping and compression equipment used to collect liquid fuel. For its part, maintenance personnel typically handle important or mission-critical tasks; low-level work (like fixing broken appliances, replacing light bulbs, and so on) is typically delegated to the facilitation track. The medical track makes sure that the Cetacean's crew is healthy enough (physically and mentally) to earn their pay without being mauled by vent crabs. They fill prescriptions, perform first aid, conduct surgical operations, and provide counseling services to the rest of the crew. Third-party contractors aboard the ship also advertise and maintain the ship's genemod kiosks, which Access Corridor receives a handsome dividend to keep around. Finally, the facilitation track manages the least glamorous and most necessary work aboard the ship: meal prep, cleaning, hauling, plumbing, freight, and low-level maintenance like restocking vending machines and providing room service for passengers. Their work isn't exciting, but it's generally understood to be critical; nobody wants to live on a dark and grimy brick of metal in space, and good facilitation workers tend to commandeer a degree of respect that their low rank in the corporate oligarchy wouldn't suggest at first glance. NHPs Although the Cetacean doesn't currently have an administrative NHP, it does feature a casket hookup. While wired into the ship's systems, an NHP would have control over much of its software and hardware, functioning as more-or-less omnipresent assistant to the human crew. Shipboard NHPs are bound via their shackles and company directives. Though they are members of the crew like any other, their unique capabilities and position means that they're handled differently than others aboard the vessel; they're free to make judgments and decisions as they see fit, but operate outside of the regular chain of command, answering only to the highest authority aboard the ship while holding no hard authority of their own despite serving an advisory role. In addition to the networking capabilities afforded by their casket (which is housed in an extremely high-security area of the Cetacean called the Cenotaph), any subalterns or drones with the appropriate hardware can be commandeered and controlled by the NHP for better executing their work or interfacing with human crew. This includes hardware under active control by a comp/con, in which case the comp/con is programmed to automatically \"hand over\" the unit until the NHP cuts the link. With the authorization of the captain, an NHP can be cycled while aboard the ship. This is a multi-step process; stable cycling requires that the casket first be isolated from the systems, after which it is placed into dormancy. Only then is the hardware fully cycled -- a process that can take minutes to days depending on the model -- after which it is reactivated, given some time to readjust, and \"plugged back in\" to the ship. Cycling outside of scheduled timeslots is intensely forbidden by protocol, and would result in all relevant parties being placed into probation until a formal investigation determines whether or not they should be either sacked for gross negligence and possibly reported to the DoJ/HR. Comp/Cons Other than the shipboard NHP, the Cetacean also includes a plethora of subalterns and drones aboard the ship, controlled either by hardcoded subroutines or by comp/cons. Although they may have a simple facsimile personality and most are capable of recognizing and producing speech, comp/cons are not intelligent or conscious; they're simply powerful computers used to control hardware in response to provided input. Like most ships, comp/con-enabled subalterns and drones aboard the Cetacean are ship property, and are programmed to follow any requests or orders given by the human crew. A strict adherence to company protocol is mandatory, although how they interpret it varies per unit depending on their specifications.","title":"ACO Cetacean"},{"location":"prelude/aco-cetacean/#aco-cetacean","text":"The Cetacean is a long-haul fuel tanker owned and operated by Access Corridor .

While aquaculture projects and terraforming plans are in feasibility studies, its toxic atmosphere (composed of roughly ninety percent carbon dioxide) makes the seeding of extant species improbable despite an ideal climate. Of more interest is the planet's three moons -- HIP 25205 d 1, 2, and 3. The second and third of these are replete with metals and are home to scattered extraction outposts that secure much of the material used to build the station itself, while the first moon benefits from perpetually-illuminated poles that allow hydroponics outposts to flourish with minimal effort. HIP 25205's other planets are of less note. HIP 25205 a is a hot ice giant predominantly composed of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, water, and sulfur dioxide, while HIP 25205 b and c are rocky worlds; any resources that could be yielded from these planets are outweighed by the cost of protecting from the intense solar radiation so close to the star. HIP 25205 e is an icy world with no features of note beyond its large collection of moons. While every major body in the system has some degree of orbital presence in the form of unmanned omni relays and navigation beacons, the vast majority of infrastructure buildup in the system can be found where it serves the most benefit: near Ngoc Linh itself.","title":"HIP 25205"},{"location":"prelude/ngoc-linh/","text":"Ngoc Linh Station Ngoc Linh Station is the southwesternmost blink gate in inhabited space. Located beyond the Hyades cluster and on the edge of inhabited space, the gate is analogous to a rush town -- perched on the perimeter of the 32 Orionis group in the HIP 25205 system, it has maintained a state of perpetual expansion since its initial construction, having enjoyed constant growth since its founding as a jumping-off point for exploration ships and colonial ventures interested in exploiting the region. Demographics Ngoc Linh is a growing population center, and owing to its nature as a blink gate, the extreme majority of its some two hundred thousand residents are immigrants from all across inhabited space, or descended from immigrants; the remainder (around seven percent), colloquially known as the old guard, can trace a lineage to the station's original seed populations. Like any blink gate, Ngoc Linh has a very diverse population; an unclassifiable stew of uncounted cultures, traditions, and beliefs, left on the stove to simmer and mix. Though the station is the size of a city and under the direct administration of Union, the station maintains a frontiersy feel that stubbornly persists despite its continuing growth, perhaps in part due to being surrounded by unexplored space. On top of its permanent population, Ngoc Linh supports a constant influx of transient visitors -- contractors, workers, representatives, passengers, researchers, travelers, tourists, officials, colonists and more -- staying temporarily on the station due to work, leisure, layover, or wanderlust. Depending on current events and the time of year, this population can fluctuate wildly, ranging from several hundred to well over fifty thousand. Layout At the broad scale, blink gates aren't like other space stations; they're expected to house a significant transient population that may even make up the majority of its residents, they are subject to consistent but unpredictable growth, and they must be scalable in throughput and capacity to match galactic trends as well as the gradual buildup of space in and around the area. For this reason, Ngoc Linh Station follows a modern \"modularity\" formula intended to ensure easy scalability into the future. The core column -- a three-kilometer long reinforced tube of supports and infrastructure -- fits snugly into the center of the superstructure like a crankshaft. This column serves as the core foundation of the blink gate, and was assembled on site as part of the gate's founding. Despite the size, it can only house around ten thousand people; much of the core is taken up by the fundamental guts required to operate something so advanced as a blink gate, including a series of gigantic power lines (known as the HPEC, or the High-Power Energy Conduit) running down the entirety of the core. When the core was filled to capacity, expansion began, and continues to this day. The column itself (and each subsequent expansion) is fitted with attachment points, structural hookups, and support struts that can easily be used to permanently \"mount\" new sections of station to the core, effectively grafting on new structure without the painful process of having to retrofit or displace extant buildup. Ngoc Linh as it is now is an amalgam of these expansion modules (called \"hab slabs\"), each of which has been purpose-built to serve various needs; residential, industrial, commerical, the works. The blink gate itself is a structure securely mounted to the far southern end of the station: a massive ring wired to the HPEC and spanning two kilometers in diameter. The station's main ports and docking clamps can also be found nearby, perpendicular to the gate and built up around the superstructure. The vast majority of Ngoc Linh's traffic passes through these ports, and so the area in and around them is densely populated with shops, corpro branch offices, regional embassies, shipyards, and a dizzying array of restaurants both from local residents as well as soulless corpro chains. This is the Concourse, spanning a thick half-kilometer ring of Ngoc Linh. Windows facing the blink gate for a view of oncoming ships are quite popular here. Mixed in with the Concourse and extending farther down the station are mixed residential areas -- high-density housing mixed in with public spaces, resource distribution centers, health clinics, and other amenities you might expect to find on a modern Metropolitan city. Outside of the Concourse, most of the station's permanent population lives in this area, which is still busy but much less well-trafficked. Further still, a narrow band of industry and processing facilities is built up just before the final third of the station, serving as the demarcating line between the station's true residential zones and the darkness of its guts. Roughly the last third of the station leading up to the north end is dominated largely by mission-critical infrastructural projects and public works. It is from this section of the station that its Dyson web sprouts; a bouquet of tremendous high-efficiency solar panels extending hundred of meters into vacuum like the tentacles of a jellyfish and taking up almost as much surface area as the rest of the station combined. It is from this web that Ngoc Linh draws all of its energy, and an army of engineers is required to maintain it. Like the north end of Ngoc Linh, the south end also has docking areas built up along the edges, though they are typically reserved for industrial vessels, freight ships, and other craft that can be diverted from the extremely competitive docking of the Concourse. Politics Ngoc Linh's governor is Novel Greenwater (he/him). As a staunch partisan of the New Humanity Front, Novel's policy decisions are well-known for mirroring his ideology: a results-driven emphasis on growth, a reduction in Union control over the station, reduced official oversight, and a focus on self-sufficiency. His political philosophy, colloquially known simply as \"Novelism\", is dominant aboard Ngoc Linh. The movement lacks a centralized message, but most approaches place an emphasis on community cohesion and preservation of individual cultural identities -- ideals that often fly in the face of the cult of personality surrounding Novel himself, which casts him as a strong leader that the station needs to function. The most hardline Novelists take this aspect a step further, advocating for a broad-scale increase of the governor's ability to directly affect change aboard the station with the end goal of creating the first truly independent blink gate: free to make their own choices and to decide for themselves what merits the hegemony's laws hold. Known as the indie movement, this philosophy of total independence has slowly expanded from a fringe movement to a genuine presence aboard the station in recent decades, largely thanks to an aggressive strategy shift that focuses on the prohibitions of the First Contact Accords and the negative impacts they have upon humanity, contrasting those prohibitions directly with the effects of Union oversight. Novelism's contradictory beliefs are frequently highlighted by its political opponents aboard the station, who point to the governor's unhesitating willingness to wield the apparatus of the hegemony despite his ostensible philosophy of a reduction in centralized power. In particular, Novel has has proven to habitually flex the presence of Union security aboard the station in order to \"bring order\" to charged situations and continually advocates for their expansion, citing them as the glue of a healthy community. Opposition and countercultural movements on Ngoc Linh accuse Novel of using his philosophy as a smokescreen to draw attention away from the actual decisions being made: an increase in security presence, tightening of resource distribution, a lack of community input on major construction plans and policy changes, and so on. All of these things, they argue, paint the lofty ideals of Novelism as nothing more than a front operation for a neo-anthrochauvinist philosophy of power consolidation, not power reduction. Novel himself has a notorious reputation for refusing to acknowledge the term \"anthrochauvinist\" at all, which only serves to make those claims more credible. Despite widening cultural schisms and growing calls for change from all across the political spectrum, the governor himself enjoys wide support across Ngoc Linh. He's soft-spoken, charismatic, sheepish, and is very skilled at describing complicated things in digestible ways, all of which have made him a popular figure. All but the most vocal of his opponents are hesitant to call his actions actively malicious (at least not openly), and instead point to his contradictory policies as an indicator of inexperience, incompetence, or cowardice.","title":"Ngoc Linh Station"},{"location":"prelude/ngoc-linh/#ngoc-linh-station","text":"Ngoc Linh Station is the southwesternmost blink gate in inhabited space.

An IPS-N careerist, Quay has lived for a staggering 203 subjective years, with just over ninety of those years spent working for IPS-N across a multitude of assignments and contracts. The Cetacean has been under his command since 5001u -- not as long as the other captains have run the ship, but still plenty of time in its own right. Quay stands at around six-and-a-half feet tall, with olive skin, small green eyes, and a taut build. His hair is a messy, short-cut scruff of light white, with trimmed sideburns running down the length of his face. He has maintained much of his functionality into old age through modern medicine: many of his organs have failed over time and been swapped with cloned replacements, more than half a dozen bones have been replaced with alloy/composite prostheses, and a modern Panacea gland has been purpose-tailored to staving off the onset of dementia. Even at 203, Quay can run, shout, exercise, and fight if needed; his capacity is much diminished from his younger years, but remains well around the average -- a feat he is very proud of. When not needed in the bridge, Quay's usual haunts include the canteen and the fore observation bubble, where he can be found talking or killing time, typically over a cup of something. This is more common than one might expect; also as a rule, Quay tends not to exercise the \"captain\" part of being the Cetacean's captain. He spends little time on the bridge, and this habit has slowly extended to much the rest of the ship's executive track as it became clear that the ship needing direct orders was the exception rather than the rule. This behavior comes to the chagrin of Access Corridor itself, which, by virtue of Quay being appointed directly by IPS-N and not ACO itself, cannot meaningfully penalize him other than reporting the behavior to IPS-N -- which are not inclined to take its subsidiary's demand for professionality seriously. As a rule, Quay is calm and amiable. The only times he raises his voice are when he's shouting across the room to make himself heard, and throughout the entirety of his tenure, he has never become any more visibly stressed or angry than pursed lips and a sigh. He is loathe to exercise his authority at all, only stepping in with his rank to coordinate response to an emergency situation or to defuse heated disagreements; the man's presence alone, however, is often enough to help cool heads win out.","title":"Captain Jeremiah Quay (he/him) - Levelheaded, Unflappable, Warm"},{"location":"prelude/people/jeremiah-quay/#captain-jeremiah-quay-hehim-levelheaded-unflappable-warm","text":"Captain Jeremiah Quay (preferred name Quay) is the captain of the Cetacean . An IPS-N careerist, Quay has lived for a staggering 203 subjective years, with just over ninety of those years spent working for IPS-N across a multitude of assignments and contracts. The Cetacean has been under his command since 5001u -- not as long as the other captains have run the ship, but still plenty of time in its own right. Quay stands at around six-and-a-half feet tall, with olive skin, small green eyes, and a taut build. His hair is a messy, short-cut scruff of light white, with trimmed sideburns running down the length of his face. He has maintained much of his functionality into old age through modern medicine: many of his organs have failed over time and been swapped with cloned replacements, more than half a dozen bones have been replaced with alloy/composite prostheses, and a modern Panacea gland has been purpose-tailored to staving off the onset of dementia. Even at 203, Quay can run, shout, exercise, and fight if needed; his capacity is much diminished from his younger years, but remains well around the average -- a feat he is very proud of. When not needed in the bridge, Quay's usual haunts include the canteen and the fore observation bubble, where he can be found talking or killing time, typically over a cup of something.

She's short compared to the Diasporan average, barely topping five feet in height, with light pinkish skin and brown eyes. She is also bald; she has no head hair or eyebrows to speak of. Most of Poppy's time is spent in the canteen: making food, mixing and sharing drinks, talking to people, cleaning the place, often all four at once. Her adherence to the bland white kitchen uniform means that she remains an incognito presence in all kinds of goings-on, which she is very observant of; sometimes she seems to know people aboard the ship more intimately than they know themselves.

Although she's technically an independent contractor, Poppy has quietly become the go-to fly on the wall during stops and shore leaves to learn tidbits of recent news.

Goat is a genetically-engineered dairy breed and sports a coat of short light chestnut fur, large eyes, and small pokey horns; she is very cautious of strangers, but is friendly and well-trained enough otherwise to be given free reign of the canteen when Poppy is around to supervise.
