# Andrea Lomes (she/her) — Hidebound, Anxious, Dutiful

Andrea Lomes is Ngoc Linh's standing primary chief of security, and is ultimately responsible for stabilizing its day-to-day goings on and managing its peacekeeping forces. Despite her dimunitive frame, she towers at over seven feet tall due to a set of unguligrade prosthetic legs that terminate in large, conical wedges that slot in to resemble hooves (although these can be swapped for high-friction rubber balls or three-toed robotic feet, as the need arises). Otherwise, she has light and blotchy skin, long brown hair kept in a ponytail, and dark yellow eyes.

Lomes likes to be present for official goings-on, but doesn't speak much without a good reason. Her imposing stature and armored vest belie a frightened mind, and a person who rarely speaks out for fear of worsening the present state of affairs. She is competent at her job and is frequently seen in public doing grunt work, but nonetheless blames herself for Novel's poor responses to the ongoing crises and appears to sincerely believe that he remains the best man for the task — just that he needs better help.

Unlike Novel himself, Lomes seems to hold only passing interest in the sociopolitics of the station beyond what's required to keep things tidy. She considers herself a Novelist and has significant sway in his cabinet, but self-admittedly engages little with things beyond that. In the past this has proven viable, but with increasing dissent and worsening crises, she seems to have found herself at a crossroads where her current approach will not remain viable for much longer. As of yet, however, she has yet to make any significant changes to her methods.

## Mission 1: In Situ

Although it wasn't obvious at the time due to the interference, Lomes is the first person aboard Ngoc Linh who made contact with the *Cetacean,* where she warned them of the lockdown and urged them not to approach.
