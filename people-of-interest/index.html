<h3 id="captain-jeremiah-quay-hehim-levelheaded-unflappable-warm">Captain Jeremiah Quay (he/him) - Levelheaded, Unflappable, Warm</h3>
<p>Jeremiah Quay (preferred name Quay) is the captain of the <em>Cetacean</em>. An IPS-N careerist, Quay has lived a staggering 203 subjective years, with just over ninety of those years spent working for IPS-N across a multitude of assignments and contracts. The <em>Cetacean</em> has been under his command since 5001u -- not as long as the other captains have run the ship, but still plenty of time in its own right.</p>
<p>Quay stands at around six-and-a-half feet tall, with olive skin, small green eyes, and a taut build. His hair is a messy, short-cut shock of light white, with sideburns running down the length of his face. He has maintained much of his functionality into old age through modern medicine: many of his organs have failed over time and been swapped with cloned replacements, more than half a dozen bones have been replaced with alloy/composite prostheses, and a modern Panacea gland has been purpose-tailored to staving off the onset of dementia. Even at 203, Quay can run, shout, exercise, and fight if needed; his capacity is much diminished from his younger years, but remains well around the average -- a feat he is very proud of.</p>
<p>When not needed in the bridge, Quay's usual haunts include the canteen and the fore observation bubble, where he can be found talking or killing time, typically over a cup of something. This is more common than one might expect; also as a rule, Quay tends not to exercise the "captain" part of being the <em>Cetacean's</em> captain. He spends little time on the bridge, and this habit has slowly extended to much the rest of the ship's executive track as it became clear that the ship needing direct orders was the exception rather than the rule. This behavior comes to the chagrin of Access Corridor itself, which, by virtue of Quay being appointed directly by IPS-N and not ACO itself, cannot meaningfully penalize him other than reporting the behavior to IPS-N -- which are not inclined to take its subsidiary's demand for professionality seriously.</p>
<p>As a rule, Quay is calm and amiable. The only times he raises his voice are when he's shouting across the room to make himself heard, and even in the tensest of moments, he has never become any more visibly stressed or angry than pursed lips and a sigh throughout the entirety of his tenure. He is loathe to exercise his authority at all, only stepping in with his rank to coordinate response to an emergency situation or to defuse heated disagreements.</p>
<h3 id="poppyseed-moray-sheher-hospitable-excited-unpredictable">Poppyseed Moray (she/her) - Hospitable, Excited, Unpredictable</h3>
<p>Poppyseed Moray, who most people just know as Poppy, is the galley cook currently out of stasis, serving on independent contract. She is a woman of indeterminate age and inscrutable thoughts.</p>
<p>Poppy is short compared to the Diasporan average, barely topping five feet in height. She has peachy skin and brown eyes, and is fully bald, sporting no head hair.</p>
<p>Most of Poppy's time is spent in the galley: making food, making and sharing drinks, talking to people, cleaning the place, sometimes all four at once. Her adherence to the bland white kitchen uniform means that she remains an incognito presence in all of the galley's goings-on, which she notes and shares at interesting times; she sometimes seems to know people aboard the ship more intimately than they know themselves. Despite her alarming awareness, though, Poppy remains well-liked; her kindness and insistence on hospitality makes her widely known.</p>
<p>Poppy also owns a live goat, which she has creatively named <strong>Goat</strong>. Goat is a genetically-engineered dairy breed and sports a coat of short light chestnut fur, large eyes, and small pokey horns; she is cautious and sometimes violent with strangers, but is friendly and well-trained enough to be given free reign of the galley when Poppy is around to supervise. She produces a hefty amount of milk that has proven a surprising boon; fresh dairy is a rare luxury in Cosmopolitan life, and Poppy uses it for cooking and to produce a variety of cheeses. Goat's diet typically consists of print-based feed with the occasional treat of greens from the hydroponics bay in the form of mixed trimmings, clippings, and weeds. It is unclear how Goat was smuggled aboard the ship, but her calmness in zero-g and reputation as a mascot figure (not to mention the fresh food) mean that the executive track's members are typically united in their response to corporate queries about the goat: what goat?</p>
